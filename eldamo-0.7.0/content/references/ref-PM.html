      <h1>People of Middle-Earth (PM)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Christopher Tolkien; 1996</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>The twelfth book in the <i>History of Middle Earth</i> series. The first part of the book discusses Tolkien’s work on the appendices to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. The other parts of the book discuss a some late essays and stories written towards the end of Tolkien’s life.
         </p>
         
         <p>The drafts of the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> appendices are problematic within the chronological scheme used in this lexicon, lying in the transition between Tolkien’s
            Middle (1930-1950) and Late Periods (after 1950). These drafts ascribe some words to the Noldorin language (Middle Period)
            that, by the time <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> was published, have become Sindarin words (Late Period). This lexicon mostly labels these words as Late Noldorin (ᴸN) but
            groups them with Sindarin. In some cases, where there is a transition between older and later forms, the lexicon treats these
            words as Noldorin (N) and groups them with that language.
