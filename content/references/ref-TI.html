      <h1>Treason of Isengard (TI)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Christopher Tolkien; 1989</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>The seventh book in the <i>History of Middle Earth</i> series. It discusses revisions in the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring (Book I), the genesis of the second half (Book
            II) and the beginning of the Two Towers (first chapters of book III). Given the early nature of this writing, its words are
            best classified as Noldorin and (Middle) Qenya, even though they are the precursors to the Sindarin and (Late) Quenya words
            of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.
