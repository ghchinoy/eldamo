      <h1>Letters from Father Christmas (LFC)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Baillie Tolkien; 1999</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A book of Christmas letters that Tolkien wrote to his children. One of these letters, written in 1929, includes a sentence
         written in the “Arctic” language. In form, it resembles the Quenya of this time period, and most scholars consider it an example
         of that language, though perhaps somewhat simplified. References are by page number; the first 2 digits of the decimal value
         are the line number, and the last 2 digits are the word position in the line.
