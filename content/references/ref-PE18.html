      <h1>Parma Eldalamberon #18 (PE18)</h1>
      <blockquote>— Unfinished; J.R.R. Tolkien, (editors) Christopher Gilson, Patrick H. Wynne, Arden R. Smith; 2009</blockquote>
      <p>
         <p>Unfinished.</p>
         
         <p>The eighteenth issue of <i>Parma Eldalamberon</i>. This issue includes two versions of the <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa</i>, a work that describes the common primitive structures of the Elvish languages. Tolkien began writing the first version (TQ1:
            PE18/23-58) in the late 1930s and began the second (TQ2: PE18/71-107) in the early 1950s as a revision of the first. Tolkien
            wrote a partial revision of TQ1, labeled “Elements of Quendian Structure”, sometime before starting TQ2 (EQS: PE18/59-68).
            PE18 also contains an article on pre-Fëanorian alphabets from the 1920s, a continuation of the first article on this topic
            from PE16.
         </p>
         
         <p>The second version of the <i>Tengwesta Qenderinwa</i> (TQ2) still predates Tolkien’s reorganization of the Elvish languages into Quenya and Sindarin, though early evidence of
            this change appear in the document, such as the name <i>Sindarin</i> for the Elves of Beleriand. The two main languages are still Quenya (Q.) spoken only by the Vanyar and Noldorin (N.) spoken
            by the Noldor, as it was in the <i>Etymologies</i>. The “Sindarin” of this document remains in the same continuum with the Beleriandic languages of the <i>Etymologies</i> (Ilkorin and Doriathrin), and is labeled “Bel.” (Beleriandic) in this lexicon.
         </p>
         
         <p>The TQ2 document is problematic for this lexicon’s divisions of Tolkien’s conceptual development, since it lies on the cusp
            between the Middle (1930-1950, pre-Sindarin) and Late (after 1950, post-Sindarin) Periods. To simplify comparison with later
            Quenya and Sindarin words, this lexicon labels the Noldorin words in TQ2 as Late Noldorin (ᴸN) or Late Old Noldorin (ᴸON),
            but groups them with Sindarin and Old Sindarin. This makes it easier to compare the information in TQ2 to earlier phonology
            documents, including TQ1 and OP1 (PE19/29-67). This also appropriately puts TQ2 in the same period as the second Outline of
            Phonology document (OP2) from PE19/68-107.
