      <h1>The Road Goes Ever On (RGEO)</h1>
      <ul>
         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, Donald Swann; 1962, 1969</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         <p>The book of songs published by Donald Swan based on the poetry in <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. This book includes an appendix of linguistic notes written by Tolkien that discuss the poems <i>Námarië</i> and <i>A Elbereth Gilthoniel</i>.
         </p>
         
         <p>There are two editions of this book with different page numbers. The references here are based on the 2nd edition from 1969,
            which is easier to find. Added 8 to the page numbers to find the locations in the 1st edition from 1962, which is how this
            reference is typically cited in other academic texts.
         </p>
         
         <p>References are by page number; the first 2 digits of the decimal value are the line number, and the last 2 digits are the
            word position in the line.
         </p>
         
         <p>Needs review.</p>
