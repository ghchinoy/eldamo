         <li>J.R.R. Tolkien, (editor) Christopher Tolkien; 1987</li>
      </ul>

         <p>The fifth book in the <i>History of Middle Earth</i> series. It discusses an unfinished story, “The Lost Road”, for which the tale of the Fall of Númenor was first developed.
            It also includes the drafts of <i>The Silmarillion</i> prior to Tolkien’s temporary abandonment of that work at the end of the 1930s to focus on <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Finally, it includes the very important <i>Etymologies</i>, a collection of Elvish words and their derivations written in the mid-1930s, referenced separately in this lexicon (<a href="ref-Ety.html">Ety</a>, <a href="ref-EtymAC.html">EtymAC</a>).
