         <blockquote>
            <p>The first mention of the “Green Elves” was in the earliest <i>Lost Tales</i>, where a group of Elves “clad in green and brown” came to the aid of Beren to avenge the death of Tinwelint, precursor to
               Thingol (LT2/234). Presumably at this stage they were part of the Ilkorin elves and spoke one of their various languages.
               In the <i>Silmarillion</i> drafts from the beginning of the 1930s, this group Elves took on the role they would take in Tolkien’s later stories, but
               at first they were only called the “Green-elves” (SM/133). Soon after, Tolkien coined the name Danian or <i><a href="word-3152421629.html">Danas</a></i> and defined the characteristics of their language distinct from the other Eldar (PE19/18).
            </p>
            
            <p>In the <i>Comparative Tables</i>, Tolkien first grouped Danian with Ilkorin, declaring that they were both languages of “Germanic” type (PE19/22 note #54).
               Tolkien changed his mind, deciding that Ilkorin was 	more Welsh-like, as Noldorin “used to be”, that is more like the Gnomish
               of Tolkien’s earlier writings. The Ilkorin columns were the relabeled Danian and new Ilkorin columns were added (PE19/18 note
               #2, PE19/19 note #11). The Early Ilkorin words attested in Early Noldorin notes from the 1920s also had a Germanic character,
               as suggested by Roman Rausch and Helios Martínez (HPITN, EIP), and thus was more of a conceptual pre-cursor to Danian than
               of later Ilkorin of the 1930s.
            </p>
            
            <p>Later still Tolkien referred to this group of Elves as the Nandor, and their language as Nandorin. See the discussion of the
               <a href="../language-pages/lang-nan.html">Nandorin language</a> for further details.
