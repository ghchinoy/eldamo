         <blockquote>
            <p>Tolkien introduced the Ilkorindi towards the end of the <i>Lost Tales</i> (LT2/9), but in this early period they seem to have filled a role more like the later Avari, as a general term for the Elves
               who did not to go to Valinor. In writings on Early Qenya Phonology from the 1920s, Tolkien described Ilkorin as a family of
               mutually unintelligible languages (PE14/62). This lexicon discusses this earlier conception seperately, as the <a href="../language-pages/lang-eilk.html">Early Ilkorin</a> language(s).
            </p>
            
            <p>In the <i>Lhammas</i> of the 1930s, Tolkien made a point to group the Ilkorins with the other Eldar, distinct from the Lembi who refused to go
               to Valinor (LR/171). At this stage the term specifically referred to the languages of the Elves of Beleriand, and these languages
               were closely related, more like dialects of the same language (LR/175).
            </p>
            
            <p>Later, Tolkien reformed the <a href="../language-pages/lang-n.html">Noldorin</a> language into <a href="../language-pages/lang-s.html">Sindarin</a>, designating it as the language of the Elves of Beleriand (WJ/5). At this point he seems to have abandoned the Ilkorin language,
               but as suggested by Edward Kloczko (Tyalië Tyelelliéva #9), Tolkien seems to have recycled some of its phonetic characteristics
               in the <a href="../language-pages/lang-ns.html">North Sindarin</a> dialect. This let Tolkien retain some of his earlier Ilkorin-based names in his later writings by recasting them as North
               Sindarin, for example NS. <i><a href="word-3143701877.html">Dor-lómin</a></i>.
