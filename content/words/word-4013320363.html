         <blockquote>
            <p>There are two known dialects of Danian: the Ossiriandic or <i><a href="word-2713700085.html">Ossiriandeb</a></i> dialect spoken by the Green Elves who entered Beleriand (LR/176, 189), and the Leikvian or East Danian dialect spoken by
               those Elves who remained beyond the Blue Mountains (LR/196). In the <i>Comparative Tables</i>, Tolkien described Ossiriandic as being of an “Old English type” and East Danian as resembling Old Norse (PE19/22). Whether
               the two dialects were mutually intelligible is unclear. Most of their phonetic developments were the same (except for vowels),
               but Tolkien given them two separate columns in the <i>Comparative Tables</i>, which he did not do with the various dialects of <a href="word-2796215059.html" v="dialects">Ilkorin</a> or <a href="word-1917760941.html" v="dialects">Noldorin</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the <i>Etymologies</i>, Tolkien marked most words as simply Danian (Dan.), only a few as Ossiriandic (Oss.), and none as East Danian. Based on phonetic
               evidence, however, many of these “Danian” words were actually Ossiriandic. For example, Dan. <i><a href="word-889363273.html">snæ̂s</a></i> had a long [ǣ], which became [ā] in East Danian (PE19/25). Further, Dan. <i><a href="word-1909053601.html">ealc</a></i> &lt; ᴹ✶<i><a href="word-2250215451.html">alk-wā</a></i> shows evidence of <a href="word-78414621.html" v="[w] vanished after medial velars in Ossiriandic">[w] vanishing after medial velars [k]</a>, something that only occurred in Ossiriandic (PE19/23). Examples of vowel-breaking such as Dan. <i><a href="word-1387201883.html">beorn</a></i> and Dan. <i><a href="word-1816999629.html">sc(i)ella</a></i> more strongly resemble Old English than Old Norse. Finally, the Danian examples used “c” to represent [k] orthographically,
               which in the <i>Comparative Tables</i> was true of Ossiriandic but not East Danian.
            </p>
            
            <p>The only attested word that might be from the East Danian dialect is that people’s name for themselves: <i><a href="word-3374786863.html">Leikvir</a></i>. It shows a [v] after velar [k], and the change [kw] &gt; [kv] is known to have occurred in East Danian (PE19/23).
