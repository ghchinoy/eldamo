            <p>Short primitive [e] was generally preserved in both Danian dialects, though it could in some circumstances develop into a
               diphthong through vowel breaking, such as <a href="word-2679347139.html" v="[a], [e], [i] broke into diphthongs before [l], [r] clusters">before consonant clusters beginning with [l], [r]</a> or after <a href="word-183255983.html" v="[e] became [ie] after initial [sk]">an initial [sk]</a>. It is also possibly that this vowel was modified by <a href="word-2418902975.html" v="[a], [u] became [e], [y] before following [i]">Danian <i>i</i>-mutation</a> (into [i]?), but there are no attested examples.
            </p>
            
            <p>There are, however, examples of primitive [a] becoming [e] via <i>i</i>-mutation, such as <i><a href="word-3967423007.html">Gochressiel</a></i> from <i><a href="word-2681035565.html">hrassa</a></i> “precipice” (Ety/KHARÁS). There are also other examples of [a] developing into [e] in the words <i><a href="word-1245432293.html">spenna</a></i> and <i><a href="word-1816999629.html">sc(i)ella</a></i>, but <a href="word-4034065825.html" v="[a] became [e] after initial [s] + voiceless stop">the exact mechanism is unclear</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>This is one note indicating that “in East Danian &amp; Taliska <i>e</i> became normally <i>i</i>” (PE19/26), but this change probably refers to an earlier conception when both East Danian and Taliska said to resemble Gothic
               (PE19/22 note #55). After East Danian was reassigned to the “Old Norse” type, this change probably only referred to <a href="word-237072255.html" v="short [ĕ] became [i]">Taliska</a>.
