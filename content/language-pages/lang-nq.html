      <p>The “High Elvish” language originally spoken by the Noldorin Elves such as Galadriel. By the Third Age, it was no longer a
         living language in Middle Earth, but survived as a language of ritual and lore in much the same way that Latin did in Medieval
         Europe (LotR/1127-8). This section includes Quenya words drawn from multiple periods throughout Tolkien’s life, as well as
         later inventions by fans (neologisms). Since this does not precisely match Tolkien’s conception of the language at any particular
         time, this section uses the “Neo-Quenya” designation, since it is in effect “Post Tolkien”. For information about Quenya as
         Tolkien conceived at in various periods of his life, see:
