      <h1>Valarin</h1>
      <p>Tolkien vacillated on whether or not the Valar used language. He sometime thought that they did not need a language (Let/282),
         perhaps communicating purely with thought (VT39/21-34). In his “Quendi and Eldar” essay from the 1960s, Tolkien did describe
         the Language of the Valar (WJ/397-407), and this is the main source of Valarin words in this lexicon. Note that in Tolkien’s
         earlier conceptions of his languages, the Valar taught speech to the Elves when they arose in Middle Earth, so that the Primitive
         Elvish of the <a href="lang-ep.html">Early</a> and <a href="lang-mp.html">Middle Periods</a> was in fact the language of the Valar.
